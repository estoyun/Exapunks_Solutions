# GOAL
~~~
Read a value from the nerve connected to your central nervous system (CNS)
and relay it to the nerve connected to your arm (ARM),
clamping the value so that it never goes below -120 or above 50.
Repeat ad infinitum*.

*ad infinitum : "무한" 또는 "영원히"를 의미하는 라틴어 문구

Since this task takes place inside a network you control
- that is, your own body - it is not necessary to leave no trace.
Your EXAs should be written to operate indefinitely.

Note that #NERV is a hardware register, not a file.
You can use it directly in your code like any other register.
